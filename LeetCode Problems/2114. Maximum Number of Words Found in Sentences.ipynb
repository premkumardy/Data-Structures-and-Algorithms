    "2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: sentences = [\"alice and bob love leetcode\", \"i think so too\", \"this is great thanks very much\"]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "- The first sentence, \"alice and bob love leetcode\", has 5 words in total.\n",
    "- The second sentence, \"i think so too\", has 4 words in total.\n",
    "- The third sentence, \"this is great thanks very much\", has 6 words in total.\n",
    "Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: sentences = [\"please wait\", \"continue to fight\", \"continue to win\"]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. \n",
    "In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= sentences.length <= 100\n",
    "1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100\n",
    "sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.\n",
    "sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.\n",
    "All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space."
